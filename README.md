# Automated_monthly_vacancy_report_DE
R markdown document, which illustrates what a montly job vacancy report could look like. It is closely related to the monthly vacancy reports published by the Australian government. 
It uses, as inputs, CEDEFOP data, which is prepared and cleaned using the same process used for the [pseudostocks project](https://github.com/OnlineJobVacanciesESSnetBigData/Pseudostocks-from-CEDEFOP-OJA). 

## Primary markdown document
